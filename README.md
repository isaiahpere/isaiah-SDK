# isaiah-SDK

## Description
The Lord of the rings SDK (Lordy SDK) was built to easily integrate the Lord of the Rings API and any other API you desire into your application. This is the 21st centery. Enough of having to build utilities for all kinds of crazy endpoints your application needs to function properly. We all know you end up defaulting to stackoverflow when structuring your code, so why not allow Lordy SDK to give you a hand instead. The Lordy SDK will save you time guarantee or stop using it. Lordy was designed to not only save you time but to also boost your code's performance and elegance. Your seniors will be proud of you as you with the help of Lordy, mainly Lordy, will refractor major companents of your application by passing the heavy lifting to the Lordy while you take care of the fun stuff, debugging problem you have no idea of its origin. ðŸ˜­

No worries, we all know behind the screen we really don't know what we are doing. This is why Lordy has made it extremely easy for any developer to pick up the SDK and easily integrate it. The integration is so simple you won't even have to google anything once to get it up and going. In fact, we went above and beyond to the point of hiring chatGPT to write crystal clear instruction to ensure the smoothest integration process and nothing less is achieved here. ðŸ˜‰
